---

## Section-by-Section Changes

### 1. HERO & PROBLEM SECTIONS
**Status:** Kept as-is ✅  
**Reason:** These were already working well

---

### 2. BUDGET SECTIONS (Previously 3 scattered sections → Now 2 focused modules)

#### OLD Structure:
- Section 1: "Always know how much money is left" (Budget & Planning)
- Section 2: "Stop overspending on furniture..." (Budget & Planning)  
- Section 3: "See everything you've bought..." (Budget & Planning) ❌ *Not actually about budget!*

#### NEW Structure:
- **Module 1: "Stop blowing your furniture budget when you still need movers"**
  - Eyebrow: Budget Setup
  - Focus: Custom categories (furnishings, moving, storage, installation)
  - Benefit: Avoid overspending in one category when others still need funding

- **Module 2: "Know if you can afford it before you swipe"**
  - Eyebrow: Budget Tracking
  - Focus: Real-time progress bars, instant updates
  - Benefit: Shop with confidence instead of anxiety

**Key Changes:**
- Removed the "see everything you've bought" section (that's inventory, not budget)
- Combined budget setup + tracking into cohesive story
- Clearer distinction: setup (categories) vs. tracking (real-time monitoring)

---

### 3. SOURCING & SHOPPING SECTIONS (Previously scattered → Now 2 clear modules)

#### NEW Structure:
- **Module 3: "Capture everything while standing in line"**
  - Eyebrow: In-Store Capture
  - Focus: Transaction recording at checkout, photo capture (cart + receipts)
  - Benefit: Capture details when fresh, never lose receipts

- **Module 4: "Remember 200 items without trying"**  
  - Eyebrow: Item Organization
  - Focus: Visual item list, search by room/source
  - Benefit: Free up mental space for design, not memorization

**Key Changes:**
- Moved receipt capture FROM install section TO sourcing (where it actually happens)
- Clarified transaction vs. item relationship
- Emphasized "capture in the moment" vs. "trying to remember later"

---

### 4. INSTALL DAY SECTION (Cleaned up category cards)

#### OLD Structure:
1. Never forget a return ✅
2. Find any receipt in seconds ✅
3. Get reimbursed without the hassle ❌ *This is billing, not install!*

#### NEW Structure:
1. Never forget a return ✅ (kept)
2. Find any receipt in seconds ✅ (kept)
3. **Filter items by room instantly** 🆕 (new - actually install-related)

**Key Changes:**
- Removed "Get reimbursed" card (moved to Billing section where it belongs)
- Added "Filter by room" feature (actually useful on install day)
- All three cards now focused on on-site execution

---

### 5. BUSINESS INVENTORY SECTION (Completely new!)

#### NEW Module 5: "Track items you're saving for future projects"
- Eyebrow: Business Inventory
- Focus: Moving items to business inventory, storage location tracking
- Benefit: "I know I have that somewhere" → "It's in Storage Area B, shelf 3"

**Key Changes:**
- Added entire section for business inventory management
- This was a major app feature completely missing from original landing page!

---

### 6. BILLING & CLOSEOUT (Previously confusing → Now crystal clear)

#### OLD Structure:
- Section A: "Send invoices in minutes, not days" (Admin & Billing)
  - Promise: Create professional invoices automatically
  
- Section B: "Professional reports without spreadsheet nightmare" (Admin & Billing)
  - Promise: Generate reports for clients automatically

**Problem:** These sounded almost identical. What's the difference between an invoice and a report?

#### NEW Structure:
- **Module 6: "Get reimbursed without the mental math"**
  - Eyebrow: Client Invoicing
  - Focus: Automatic tracking of who paid, reconciliation, getting money back
  - Benefit: Get paid faster, no spreadsheets, no memory games
  - **Purpose:** Get reimbursed for money you're owed

- **Module 7: "Make clients feel amazing about working with you"**
  - Eyebrow: Project Documentation
  - Focus: Purchase price vs. market value, showing savings to clients
  - Benefit: Drive repeat and referral business
  - **Purpose:** Demonstrate value to build relationships

**Key Changes:**
- NOW the distinction is clear:
  - Invoice = "who owes whom" (transactional)
  - Client Summary = "look how much you saved" (relational)
- Different eyebrows (Invoicing vs. Documentation)
- Different benefits (get paid vs. get referrals)

---

### 7. HOW IT WORKS SECTION (Updated to match new workflow)

#### OLD Steps:
1. Create your project
2. Add items as you source
3. Handle install day chaos
4. Bill progressively
5. Close with complete documentation

#### NEW Steps:
1. **Set up your budget** - Custom categories, real-time tracking
2. **Capture while you shop** - Transactions, items, photos, receipts
3. **Handle install day chaos** - Returns, receipts, room filters
4. **Move extras to inventory** 🆕 - Business inventory with storage tags
5. **Bill and close with confidence** - Invoices + value summaries

**Key Changes:**

- Clarified what happens in each step
- Aligned with the 5 workflow phases

---

### 8. PRICING SECTION (Updated features list)

- Real-time budget tracking

---

### 9. FAQ SECTION (Added new question)

#### NEW FAQ:
**"What's the difference between the invoice and client summary?"**
- Invoice = reconciles who owes whom (reimbursement focus)
- Client Summary = shows purchase vs. market value (relationship focus)

**Key Changes:**
- Proactively addresses the confusion that existed in the old version

---

## Summary Statistics

### OLD Version (`index-apple.html`):
- 6 feature sections
- 3 labeled "Budget & Planning" (one wasn't even about budget)
- 2 labeled "Admin & Billing" (nearly identical messaging)
- 1 "Install Day" section with billing card mixed in
- 0 Business Inventory sections
- Confusing distinction between invoicing and reports

### NEW Version (`index-workflow.html`):
- 7 feature modules organized by 5 workflow phases
- Clear progression: Budget → Sourcing → Install → Inventory → Billing
- Each section has distinct purpose and messaging
- Business Inventory section added
- Clear distinction between Invoice (get paid) vs. Client Summary (show value)
- All features appear at the moment they're actually used

---

## The Core Improvement

**OLD:** Organized by vague department names (Admin, Billing, Planning)  
**NEW:** Organized by designer's actual project workflow (Setup → Shop → Install → Store → Bill)

**Result:** Each section now has ONE clear job to do, appears at the right moment in the workflow, and doesn't repeat messaging from other sections.
