## Summary: The Workflow Arc

```
BUDGET SETUP → SOURCING → INSTALL → INVENTORY → BILLING
     ↓            ↓          ↓          ↓           ↓
  Categories   Transactions  Returns   Storage   Reconcile
   Progress      Items      Receipts   Tracking  Invoices
   Tracking    Photos/Notes  Scanning   Search    Client Value
```

**Core insight:** The app's foundation is the **transaction → item** relationship, which mirrors how designers actually work (one shopping trip = transaction, things bought = items).

**The accounting tab distinction:**
- Lives alongside budget tab
- Tracks who owes whom automatically
- Generates two different outputs:
  1. **Invoice** (get paid)
  2. **Client Summary** (show value)

This structure now maps cleanly to how designers actually move through a project, with features appearing at the exact moment they're needed.
