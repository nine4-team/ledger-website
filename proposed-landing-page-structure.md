# Proposed Landing Page Structure
*Organized by designer workflow, not department names*

---

## HERO SECTION
**Keep as is** - Works great

---

## PROBLEM SECTION  
**Keep as is** - Clearly sets up the pain points

---

## SOLUTION OVERVIEW
**Keep as is** - Transitions nicely into features

---

## FEATURE SECTIONS (Reorganized by Workflow Phase)

### 🎯 Section 1: BUDGET SETUP & TRACKING
*Replace the three scattered "Budget & Planning" sections*

#### Module 1A: "Know exactly what you can spend before you swipe"
- **Eyebrow:** Budget Setup
- **Headline:** "Stop guessing. Start knowing."
- **Copy:** Set up custom budget categories that match your real workflow—furnishings, installation services, moving, storage. See real-time progress bars for each category so you know exactly what's left before you buy.
- **Benefit:** No more "oops I spent the moving budget on sofas"

#### Module 1B: "See your budget update in real-time"
- **Eyebrow:** Budget Tracking
- **Headline:** "Shop with confidence, not anxiety"
- **Copy:** Visual progress bars show what's left in each category as you spend. Know if you can afford that $800 chair before you buy it, not after you've blown the budget.
- **Benefit:** Make smart spending decisions in the moment, not regret them later

**Why this works:** Combines budget categories + real-time tracking into ONE cohesive "budget" story. Currently these are split across 3 sections with inventory mixed in.

---

### 🎯 Section 2: SOURCING & SHOPPING
*Consolidate the scattered sourcing/receipt features*

#### Module 2A: "Capture everything while you're standing in line"
- **Eyebrow:** In-Store Capture
- **Headline:** "Stop losing receipts before you even get to the car"
- **Copy:** Record transaction details while standing in checkout—snap photos of your cart and receipt, note who paid, mark the budget category. By the time you get home, you've already forgotten half of it. Capture it now when it's fresh.
- **Benefit:** Never lose a receipt, never forget who paid, never wonder where the money went

#### Module 2B: "See everything you've bought in one visual list"
- **Eyebrow:** Item Organization
- **Headline:** "Remember all 200 items without trying"
- **Copy:** Every item shows up with its photo, price, receipt, and room assignment. Scroll through and instantly spot what's missing. Search by room ("living room"), by source ("HomeGoods"), or just scan visually.
- **Benefit:** Your brain is for designing, not memorizing shopping lists across 4 projects

**Why this works:** 
- Moves "capture receipts" from Install section to where it actually happens (during shopping)
- Clarifies that "seeing all items" is about INVENTORY, not budget
- Shows the transaction → item relationship

---

### 🎯 Section 3: INSTALL DAY CHAOS
*Keep focused only on on-site activities*

**Category Cards Module:** "Install Day Made Simple"
- Keep as is, BUT remove "Get reimbursed" card (that's billing, not install)
- Replace with: **"Find items by room in seconds"**
  - Copy: "Need all the living room items? Type 'living room' and see only what goes in that space. Stop hunting through 200-item lists trying to remember where things go."

**Three cards:**
1. Never forget a return ✅ (keep)
2. Find any receipt in seconds ✅ (keep)
3. **Filter items by room** 🆕 (replaces reimbursement card)

**Why this works:** Everything in this section is now about on-site execution, not accounting/billing.

---

### 🎯 Section 4: BUSINESS INVENTORY
*NEW SECTION - This is a major feature that's completely missing*

#### Module 4: "Track items you're keeping for future projects"
- **Eyebrow:** Business Inventory
- **Headline:** "Stop losing track of great deals in your storage unit"
- **Copy:** Found an amazing chair but it didn't work for this project? Can't return that lamp but know you'll use it later? Move items into your business inventory section. Tag them with storage locations. Search and find them when you need them.
- **Benefit:** Turn "I know I have that somewhere" into "It's in Storage Area B"

**Why this works:** This is a whole top-level section of your app that's currently not mentioned on the landing page at all!

---

### 🎯 Section 5: BILLING & CLOSEOUT
*Split the redundant "Admin & Billing" into two DISTINCT sections*

#### Module 5A: "Get reimbursed without the mental math"
- **Eyebrow:** Client Invoicing
- **Headline:** "Who owes whom? The app knows."
- **Copy:** The app automatically tracks every purchase and who paid—you or the client. Generate a professional invoice that reconciles everything in seconds. Bill throughout the project or all at once at the end.
- **Benefit:** Get paid faster, no spreadsheets, no memory games

**Key messaging:**
- Focus on REIMBURSEMENT (getting paid back)
- Emphasize automatic tracking of "who paid"
- Mention progressive billing throughout project

#### Module 5B: "Show clients the value you delivered"
- **Eyebrow:** Project Documentation  
- **Headline:** "Make clients feel amazing about working with you"
- **Copy:** Generate a detailed breakdown showing every item with purchase price vs. market value. Even if you use markups, clients see how much money they saved by working with you instead of going solo.
- **Benefit:** Drive repeat and referral business by demonstrating value

**Key messaging:**
- Focus on VALUE DEMONSTRATION (client relationship)
- Emphasize market value vs. purchase price
- Mention repeat/referral business driver

**Why this works:** 
- NOW it's clear these are two different documents for different purposes
- One is "get paid" (transaction-focused)
- Other is "build relationship" (value-focused)
- No more confusion about "invoices vs. reports"

---

## HOW IT WORKS SECTION
**Update the steps to match new workflow**

1. **Set up your budget** - Create custom categories and know what you can spend
2. **Capture while you shop** - Record transactions and items in line at the store
3. **Handle install day** - Mark returns, find receipts, filter by room
4. **Move extras to inventory** - Save items for future projects with storage tracking
5. **Bill and close** - Generate reimbursement invoices and value summaries

## PRICING, FAQ, FINAL CTA, FOOTER
**Keep as is** - These work well

## Summary of Changes

### REMOVED:
- ❌ "Budget & Planning" label on inventory feature
- ❌ "Get reimbursed" card from Install Day section
- ❌ Redundant "no spreadsheets" messaging from every section
- ❌ Vague "Admin & Billing" sections

### ADDED:
- ✅ Clear budget setup section (categories + tracking together)
- ✅ Dedicated sourcing section (transactions + items)
- ✅ Business inventory section (completely missing before!)
- ✅ "Filter by room" install day feature
- ✅ Clear distinction between Invoice (get paid) vs. Client Summary (show value)

### REORGANIZED:
- ✅ Receipt capture moved from install to sourcing (where it actually happens)
- ✅ "Who paid" tracking moved from install to billing (where it's actually used)
- ✅ Inventory visibility separated from budget tracking (they're different concerns)

---

## Before vs. After Section Count

**BEFORE:**
- Budget & Planning: 3 sections (confusing, one wasn't even about budget)
- Install Day: 1 section with 3 cards (one card was actually about billing)
- Admin & Billing: 2 sections (nearly identical messaging)
- **Total: 6 feature sections**

**AFTER:**
- Budget Setup & Tracking: 2 modules (clearly about money/spending)
- Sourcing & Shopping: 2 modules (clearly about capturing purchases)
- Install Day: 1 section with 3 cards (all actually about install)
- Business Inventory: 1 module (NEW - major feature that was missing)
- Billing & Closeout: 2 modules (clearly distinct purposes)
- **Total: 8 feature sections (clearer, more complete)**

---

## Key Insight

The app is organized around **Transactions and Items**, which mirrors how designers actually work:
- One HomeGoods trip = **1 transaction** (receipt, total, who paid)
- 15 things bought = **15 items** (each with photo, price, room, disposition)

The landing page should show this relationship clearly in the Sourcing section, because that's what makes the app intuitive.

---

## Next Step

Would you like me to:
1. **Implement this structure in the actual HTML** (full rewrite of feature sections)
2. **Review specific copy for any of these sections** before implementing
3. **Create a comparison view** showing old vs. new side-by-side for specific sections

Just let me know how you want to proceed!
