## Problem Statement

### You're an incredible designer. But the business side is exhausting.

Between juggling multiple projects, tracking dozens of purchases, managing budgets, and billing clients—the administrative burden can crush your creative flow.

You deserve tools that match your talent.

---

## Solution Overview

**Finally, an app that handles the chaos so you can focus on what you do best.**

Our platform gives you real-time visibility into your project budgets, automates invoicing, tracks every item and receipt, and keeps you organized from concept to installation—all in one beautiful, intuitive interface.

## Features

### 💰 Budget & Planning

#### Real-Time Budget Visibility
See exactly where you stand—instantly. No more mental math or surprise overages.

A live, visual dashboard shows your project spending and remaining budget at a glance. Make smart purchasing decisions on the fly, prioritize what matters, and keep multiple projects on track without the stress.

**Why it matters:** When you're juggling three rooms across two states, you need to know if you can afford that perfect vintage piece—right now, not after digging through receipts.

---

#### Budget Category Breakdown
Because "furnishings budget" means more than just furniture.

Divide your budget into real categories: furnishings, accessories, moving costs, install crews, storage, and more. Stop accidentally overspending on sofas when you still need to pay movers.

**Why it matters:** That $50K budget looks generous until you realize $8K goes to logistics. Our category breakdown keeps you honest and prevents last-minute budget scrambles.

---

#### Centralized Project Inventory
Everything you've sourced, in one clean view.

No more "Wait, did I already order the throw pillows?" Scroll through every item for a project, spot missing pieces instantly, and stay organized even when switching between clients.

**Why it matters:** Your brain is for designing beautiful spaces, not memorizing 200 line items across four projects.

---

### 🛋️ Sourcing & Install Workflow

#### One-Tap Return Tracking
Because installs are chaotic, and your memory isn't perfect.

During an install, mark rejected items with one tap. When the dust settles, you'll have a clean list of exactly what to return—no forgotten items in your trunk, no lost refunds.

**Why it matters:** That lamp that looked perfect online but terrible in person? Don't let it sit in your car for three months. Tag it, return it, move on.

---

#### Receipt-Attached Items
Every item, every receipt, zero hunting.

Link receipts to items automatically—whether you bought in-store or online. Pull up proof of purchase instantly for returns, warranty claims, or client questions.

**Why it matters:** "Where's that receipt?" is now a question you'll never ask again. Save hours of email searching and glove-compartment excavations.

---

#### Purchase Source Tracking
Know who paid for what—instantly.

Clear tagging shows whether you or your client purchased each item. Simplify reimbursements, keep financial records accurate, and never mix up who owes what.

**Why it matters:** When it's time to calculate profit or request client reimbursement, everything is already organized. No forensic accounting required.

---

### 📄 Admin & Billing

#### Business-Friendly Invoicing
From creative genius to paid professional—in minutes.

Generate polished, professional invoices automatically for all selected or installed items. No more procrastinating on billing because it's tedious. Keep your cash flow healthy and your projects moving.

**Why it matters:** You're incredible at design, not accounting. Get invoices out the door in minutes instead of days—and get paid faster.

---

#### Progressive Project Billing
Get paid throughout the project, not just at the end.

Send invoices as purchases happen instead of hitting clients with one painful lump sum. Clients appreciate the transparency, and you get paid faster without financial bottlenecks.

**Why it matters:** A $80K invoice at the end of a 6-month project? Painful for everyone. Spread it out naturally, keep clients happy, and maintain steady cash flow.

---

#### Automatic Itemized Breakdown for Clients
Documentation that creates itself.

During your creative flow, the app tracks everything. When you're done, generate a complete itemized breakdown instantly—no reconstructing receipts, no tedious admin work.

**Why it matters:** Give clients and property managers clean, professional documentation without sacrificing hours to spreadsheet purgatory.

---
